  ##### In-class application #### 
  #  Part 1: Practice with the breakpoints:  
  #    What is the breakpoint doing inside the for loops?
  #      note: you can add/remove breakpoints while debugging (especially useful when in for loops)
  #    Put it two (or more) breakpoints and use Continue
  #  Part 2: Humidity vs Precipitation boxplots
  #    Humidity goes on the y-axis
  #    Two boxes on the x-axis: (1) Days that had precip (2) Days that had no precip
  #    Use "weatherType" column to determine precipitation
  #      days with precip have either "RA" or "SN" in the "weatherType" column
  #    Break down the problem -- try to individually get "RA" and "SN" before trying to combine them
