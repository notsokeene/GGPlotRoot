  ## Assignment
  # 1) Find which rows in the temps column are Celsius (no unit means Fahrenheit)
  # 2) Extract the number from every row -- paid heed to signs and decimals
  # 3) Create a numeric vector from the extracted numbers
  # 4) Challenge: Create a numeric temperature column in the data frame where all 
  #               values are Fahrenheit.  formula: F = (9/5) * C + 32
  # 5) Email belinsky@msu.edu this script with subject "grep"
